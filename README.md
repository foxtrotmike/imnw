# imnw: Is My Net Working?
Real Time Plot of Google Search Time

This is a simple script to plot the time it takes for your internet connection to search a random string on google and return the results. This can be used as a proxy for analyzing the quality of your Internet connection.

It can also be used as an exercise to teach/learn real time plotting in bokeh.
